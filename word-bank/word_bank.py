"""
- The word guessing game will prompt the player to guess a 5-letter word.
- As the player submits their word guess, the game will give feedback as to whether the letters within their guess are in the word to guess

- If the player guesses the correct letter in the correct position, that letter will be filled in on the console. 
- If they guess a correct word that belongs to in the word, but it is in the wrong position, that letter will be added to a list of misplaced letters, and an underscore will be shown in that position on the console. 
- If they guess an incorrect letter that does not belong in the word, that letter will be added to a list of incorrect letters, and an underscore will be shown in that position in the console.

- The user will have a maximum of 5 tries to guess the word
